# Contributing to the HPC Basics documentation project

Here we have resources and information needed to effectively contribute to the HPC Basics documentation project. This project is meant to coordinate effort into producing documentation to assist folks that have little or no prior experience in managing linux clusters to learn more about the different components, technologies, and processes that are utilized in managing HPC environments.
