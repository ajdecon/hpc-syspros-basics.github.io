# CPU Benchmarks

## HPL

The High Performance Linpack benchmark is the oldest and most widely accepted benchmark that measures the double precision floating point performance of distributed memory clusters. The benchmark is the standard for benchmarking the collective CPU performance of an entire system and is used as the primary means of measurement for placement of machines on the [TOP 500 list](https://www.top500.org/).
