# Benchmarking

Benchmarking is the practice of running tests on your hardware to verify performance and in some cases stress the hardware to ensure that the hardware is capable of sustained workloads. When we talk about gathering performance numbers or ensuring that the performance of a node is within an acceptable range we use the term **benchmark**. When we talk about pushing a machine to the point of errors or breaking we use the term **stress testing**.
